Este dataset se ha extraido del trabajo proben1, el cual hizo uso del
UCI machine learning database: "diabetes". Este dataset ya se ha 
limpiado de valores faltantes y normalizado, como se explica a 
continuación.

 Encoding:
===========

Although there are no missing values in this dataset according to its
documentation, there are several senseless 0 values. These most probably
indicate missing data. Nevertheless, we handle this data as if it was real,
thereby introducing some errors (or noise, if you want) into the dataset.

Attribute information: (no missing values)
0. Number of times pregnant
 1  continuous  0...17 --> 0...1  (34 records have x > 10)
1. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 1  continuous  0...199 --> 0...1 (5 records with value 0 are probably
    erroneous or indicate missing data; we just don't care)
2. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 1  continuous  0...122 --> 0...1  (35 records with value 0, next higher is 24)
3. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 1  continuous  0...99 --> 0...1  (227 records with value 0, next higher is 7)
4. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 1  continuous  0...846 --> 0...1  (347 records with value 0, next higher is 14)
5. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 1  continuous  0...67.1 --> 0...1 (11 records with value 0, next higher is 18)
6. Diabetes pedigree function
 1  continuous  0.078...2.42 --> 0...1
7. Age (years)
 1  continuous  21...81 --> 0...1

 The dataset:
===========

Diagnose diabetes of Pima indians. Based on personal data (age, number of 
times pregnant) and the results of medical examinations (e.g. blood 
pressure, body mass index, result of glucose tolerance test, etc.), try 
to decide whether a Pima indian individual is diabetes positive or not.

3. Past Usage:
    1. Smith,~J.~W., Everhart,~J.~E., Dickson,~W.~C., Knowler,~W.~C., \&
       Johannes,~R.~S. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast
       the onset of diabetes mellitus.  In {\it Proceedings of the Symposium
       on Computer Applications and Medical Care} (pp. 261--265).  IEEE
       Computer Society Press.

       The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the
       patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization
       criteria (i.e., if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 
       200 mg/dl at any survey  examination or if found during routine medical
       care).   The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

       Results: Their ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between
       0 and 1.  This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff of 
       0.448.  Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity
       of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.

4. Relevant Information:
      Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from
      a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at
      least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning
      routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like
      devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

5. Number of Instances: 768

6. Number of Attributes: 8 plus class 

7. For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)
   1. Number of times pregnant
   2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
   5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
   7. Diabetes pedigree function
   8. Age (years)
   9. Class variable (0 or 1)

8. Missing Attribute Values: None

9. Class Distribution: (class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for
   diabetes")

   Class Value  Number of instances
