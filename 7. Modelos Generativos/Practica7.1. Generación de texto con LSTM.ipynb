    "Lo primero que necesitamos son muchos datos de texto que podamos usar para aprender un modelo de lenguaje. Podrías usar cualquier archivo de texto suficientemente grande o un conjunto de archivos de texto como Wikipedia, El Señor de los Anillos, etc. En este ejemplo utilizaremos algunos de los escritos de Nietzsche, el filósofo alemán de finales del siglo XIX (traducido al inglés). El modelo lingüístico que aprenderemos será, por lo tanto, específicamente un modelo del estilo de escritura y de los temas de elección de Nietzsche, en lugar de un modelo más genérico de la lengua inglesa."

    "Como puedes ver, una baja temperatura resulta en un texto extremadamente repetitivo y predecible, pero donde la estructura local es muy realista: en particular, todas las palabras (una palabra es un patrón local de caracteres) son palabras reales en inglés. Con temperaturas más altas, el texto generado se vuelve más interesante, sorprendente, incluso creativo; a veces puede inventar palabras completamente nuevas que suenan algo plausibles (como \"eterned\" o \"troveration\"). Con una temperatura alta, la estructura local comienza a descomponerse y la mayoría de las palabras parecen cadenas de caracteres semiautomáticas. Sin duda, aquí 0,5 es la temperatura más interesante para la generación de texto en esta configuración específica. Experimenta siempre con múltiples estrategias de muestreo! Un equilibrio inteligente entre la estructura aprendida y la aleatoriedad es lo que hace que la generación sea interesante.\n",

    "Ten en cuenta que al entrenar un modelo más grande, más largo, con más datos, puedes lograr muestras generadas que se verán mucho más coherentes y realistas que las nuestras. Pero, por supuesto, no esperes generar ningún texto significativo, salvo por casualidad: todo lo que estamos haciendo es muestrear datos de un modelo estadístico de qué caracteres vienen después de qué caracteres. El lenguaje es un canal de comunicación, y hay una distinción entre lo que son las comunicaciones y la estructura estadística de los mensajes en los que se codifican las comunicaciones. Para evidenciar esta distinción, he aquí un experimento de pensamiento: ¿qué pasaría si el lenguaje humano hiciera un mejor trabajo en la compresión de las comunicaciones, como lo hacen nuestros ordenadores con la mayoría de nuestras comunicaciones digitales? Entonces el lenguaje no sería menos significativo, pero carecería de una estructura estadística intrínseca, lo que haría imposible aprender un modelo de lenguaje como el que acabamos de hacer.\n",

    "* Podemos generar datos de secuencia discreta entrenando un modelo para predecir los siguientes tokens dados los tokens anteriores.\n",
    "* En el caso del texto, este modelo se denomina \"modelo lingüístico\" y puede basarse en palabras o caracteres.\n",
    "* El muestreo del siguiente token requiere un equilibrio entre la adhesión a lo que el modelo juzga probable y la introducción de la aleatoriedad.\n",
    "* Una manera de manejar esto es la noción de _softmax temperature_. Experimenta siempre con diferentes temperaturas para encontrar la más adecuada."
